CallbackDialer is a Android application, and consists of two parts: widget and caller.
Widget provides toggle button for enable/disable caller.
Caller makes http query to web callback script on your home server.
Callback script should accept from and to parameters and create asterisk call file.
Call file says asterisk to originate calls to "from" and "to" sides and connect them.

Example callback script is "callback.pl".
